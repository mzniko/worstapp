# Mobile Demo Apps

Internally distributed demo apps for Mobile APM

https://source.datanerd.us/mobile/mobile-demo-apps


## iOS

To build the iOS mobile demo app you will need cocoapods.

http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html

After that, install referenced pods...

    $ cd iOS
    $ pod install

And ensure you open the workspace, not the project, in Xcode:

    $ open MobileDemo.xcworkspace

Have fun!
