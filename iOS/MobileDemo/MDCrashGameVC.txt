This demo is a game.

Chase the numbered buttons around the screen, tapping them in order. 

1...

2...

3...

But there is an error in the code. 

Play the game until it crashes, then re-launch the app to send the crash to New Relic.

1. Seek out the crash report in MDCrashGameVC.m.
2. What line is the exception on?
3. Can you tell what button has the fatal flaw by examining the details of crash occurrences?
